# Applied Statistics

## Description

In this project, I work through the problem sets from the textbook [Applied Statistics and the SAS Programming Language, Fifth Edition](https://www.amazon.com/Applied-Statistics-SAS-Programming-Language/dp/0131465325/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&ie=UTF8&qid=1507585211&sr=1-1&keywords=Applied+Statistics+and+the+SAS+Programming+Language) by Ron Cody and Jeffrey Smith.
